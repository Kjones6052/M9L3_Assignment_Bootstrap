# **Hello, World**

This repository contains my assignment for Bootstrap Contents and Typography, Module 9 Lesson 3.

Overview:
For this assignment I used a web page that was originally created for a previous assignment. With the web page I added and adjusted elements of 
the web page to complete the tasks specified below using Bootstrap. The web page is designed to provide information about a ficticious company 
called Tech Solutions and detailing some key services offered by the company. Also included on the web page is a thumbnail gallery, table, and a 
contact form with button.

Tasks Completed:
Part 1 Task 1: This task was completed by adding Bootstrap typography classes to all header and paragraph sections.
Part 1 Task 2: This task was completed by adding Bootstrap color class to style the links in the footer and the button at the bottom of the form. 
Part 1 Task 3: This task was completed by adding Bootstrap text alignment and emphasis classes to various sections.
Part 1 Task 4: This task was completed by adding Bootstrap colors to the background of the entire web page, as well as changing the background color
of some elements of the web page.
Part 1 Task 5: This task was completed by adding a table using Bootstrap to obtain alternating row colors.
Part 2 Task 1: This task was completed by making the images in the about and services sections responsive using Bootstrap image classes.
